						<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
			<p>Like most website operators, Musi4 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Musi4's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Musi4's visitors use its website. From time to time, Musi4 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>Musi4 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://script.google.com/a/nv.ccsd.net/macros/s/AKfycbzW8NGfRyU1fBFrlipP6NkFWumD_E51Wh4XHsCoqnEA/dev blog posts. Musi4 only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

			<p>Certain visitors to Musi4's websites choose to interact with Musi4 in ways that require Musi4 to gather personally-identifying information.
